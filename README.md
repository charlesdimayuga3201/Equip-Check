# EquipCheck: Safety Equipment Mapping and Maintenance Management System
# Introduction
Nowadays, safety equipment is frequently disregarded given that people do not know how to utilize and maintain it properly. Because of this ignorance, safety equipment may not be used effectively as aimed for, which may result in accidents and emergencies. Accidents typically happen as a result of unawareness, a lack of common sense, a failure to follow directions, or mistakes made when doing studies. However, emergencies and catastrophes have the potential to occur at any time, therefore, it's important to be prepared to respond to these. Emergency situations and catastrophes can strike at any time. Therefore, it must take steps toward preventing such in order to ensure that to become prepared for everything by properly mapping the floorplan, maintaining and monitoring the safety equipment effectively, so that the safety equipment is accessible, functional, and ready to use in the event of a disaster. Because all of the safety equipment was properly monitored and operational, it must be vital for people and organizations to be knowledgeable to take measures more quickly and efficiently in order to minimize the possibility of harm and damage. Utilizing safety equipment like fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and fire sprinklers can make it easier to prevent emergencies and deal with catastrophes. 

  In this project, the buildings and safety equipment of the Batangas State University, The National Engineering University - Alangilan Campus are managed by the departments and offices including the Environment Management Unit (EMU) and the Project Facilities and Management Office (PFMO) Alangilan Campus. These offices contain records detailing the inspection and monitoring of safety equipment. However, the researchers found that there is one significant challenge in which there is no system for safety equipment, and that safety equipment information exists primarily on paper-based. In addition, the researchers will not remove the paper that identifies the card that is attached or included in each safety equipment or inspection records because these forms are part of the government's precautionary measures. Moreover, to have a faster, better and effective management system for the safety equipment, the researchers will be upgrade the process in which it will still be placed in the proposed system because when all of the information of the safety equipment is being compiled, it can be organized, monitored, tracked efficiently, and instantly viewed the history and records.

  Moreover, another significant challenge is that several safety equipment records were missing and have not been thoroughly examined due to their information being incomplete. There is always the possibility that a paper document will be lost, misplaced, or destroyed by mistake. An authorized person may forget where they left a document or return it to the improper place. Further to that, the proposed system is also intended for use in hardware devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

  This project aims to have every information included in the floorplan where the mapping out will be thorough for identifying issues to quickly update and go into in the system that will be developed by the researchers. Moreover, the system also seeks to give a much more efficient management approach by managing safety equipment in an organized and comprehensive approach.

  The additional significant challenge is that there is so much safety equipment that it will take a long time in each department or building to manage, maintain and keep track of where each safety equipment is located. This project provides a floorplan to map out where the safety equipment is located. So that it can be quickly tracked by personnel of the Environment Management Unit (EMU) and the Project Facilities and Management Office (PFMO) offices. 
	
  As a result, this project can monitor, check maintenance, and keep track of safety equipment information that will help its client, which is the offices of Environment Management Unit (EMU) and the Project Facilities and Management Office (PFMO) of Batangas State University, The National Engineering University -  Alangilan Campus, which will help the university's growth in safety equipments as well as ensure that the safety equipments will can be used in times of emergencies or a catastrophes.

# SDG
SDG 17's aim is aligned with the value offered by Â collaboration in supporting the execution and maintenance of safety equipment. 
Ultimately, through integrating SDG 17 into safety equipment, it recognizes that a comprehensive and coordinated plan must be developed for the safety of individuals as well as communities. This helps to the ultimate goal of sustainable development by establishing cooperation, mobilizing resources, stimulating technological advances, and ensuring accessible access to university safety equipment.




# Purpose and Description
Safety equipment is one of the most important ones utilized, especially when there is a catastrophe, it is necessary that we focus on it as well as monitor, check, and manage it appropriately and efficiently. The researchers will design and develop a system for Batangas State University, The National Engineering University - Alangilan Campus that can help in the offices of Environmental Management Unit (EMU) and Project Facility Management Office (PFMO) in managing, checking, monitoring, and tracking of safety equipment along with its information. Furthermore, the goal of this project is to have better management in safety equipment, which will benefit the head admin and staff of the mentioned offices as well as the campus's technological advancement. 
It additionally contains a floorplan that can be mapped to view or identify each safety equipment on a particular floor or building with greater efficiency. It is also advantageous to be able to look through and determine, as to whether a safety equipment  is functional or not. To summarize, this system will enable the Environmental Management Unit and Project Facility Management Office to have more centralized management, which will benefit the whole of the university





# Significance of the Proposed Project
  In various industries, safety equipment is a significant aspect of ensuring the safety of people working in those various industries and preventing or lessening the damage dealt by accident or catastrophes. The development system entitled EquipCheck: Safety Mapping and Maintenance System has a significant implication on continuous development of Batangas State University, The National Engineering University - Alangilan Campus. As the University is continuously growing there are also risks and dangers attached to it. The lack of an effective management system for safety equipment can result in serious accidents and injuries, which can have significant financial, legal and ethical consequences for the organization and individuals involved. A related work injury or accident can not only keep an employee out of work for an extended period of time and have a negative influence on their quality of life; it additionally has the potential to damage the organization's efficiency, finances, and credibility.

  The researchers discovered that the only processes the clients use for maintenance and managing the safety equipment are through pen and paper. Therefore, it is significant that developing the management system for safety equipment could be a great help, essential and beneficial to ensure that the safety equipment is properly maintained, inspected and checked.  Furthermore, the development of the project is significant in which it also aims to provide a much more effective approach to management as it could provide a structured and comprehensive approach to managing safety equipment. The system can also help the organization to ensure compliance, there are strict regulations governing the uses and management of safety equipment, with the help of the system the organization can ensure that they are meeting these regulatory requirements, avoid penalties and legal issues. 

  The system also provides a significance for future researchers, as it provides a mapping of floorplan Batangas State University Alangilan Campus that locates specific safety equipment. With EquipCheck: Safety Mapping and Maintenance System,it also provides a much more efficient and accurate way of tracking and monitoring, which ensures that the equipment is properly working, replaced or maintained. With the development it could be significant for the future as it could be a valuable resource for future researchers especially those in the field of safety and IT industry. 

  Furthermore, because the client of this project is the EMU or Environmental Management Unit, this proposed system could be helpful and is covered by the Sustainable Development Goal 17 Partnership for the Goals. It intends to boost implementation methods and regain the global partnership for sustainable development. Goal 17 asks for the strengthening of implementation tools as well as the development and growth of partnerships with stakeholders.

  Overall, the development of EquipCheck: Safety Mapping and Maintenance System is significant with the reason that it improves not only the Environmental Management Unit and Project Facilities Management Office but also the University safety performance, ensures regulatory compliance and the commitment on safety of the whole University.
